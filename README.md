LIRI is kind of like SIRI, but not as sexy. LIRI is a Node.js CLI that will turn a few tricks. For those of you aspiring to be neckbeards, who don't know what a "CLI" is, well, it's geek-speak for Command Line Interface. That's right, you summon LIRI at the command line, provided you've installed the necessary components. Enough of this, here's how to use LIRI:
# LIRI Commands<br>
`node liri my-tweets`  `(returns the last 20 tweets from easyt4321 from the Twitter API)`
`node liri spotify-this-song [your song here]` `(returns a matching song from the Spotify API)`
`node liri movie-this [movie name]` `(returns a matching movie from the OMDB API)`
`node liri do-what-it-says` `(returns a song that was read from a text file)`

Enjoy
